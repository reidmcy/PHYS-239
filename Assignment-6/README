Question 2 notes:
Subtracting D^- from D^+ gives 12f'(x) + O(h^4)

Question 3 notes:
With log of df/dx - 5 get:
1862 Floating point exception: 8   ./$bname
error, since log(0) is undefined.
This occurs because the approxiamtion if perfectly accurate and thus has no error

Question 4 notes:
used f'(x) = (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h from taylor expansion
